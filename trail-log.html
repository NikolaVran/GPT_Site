      <h1>Trail Log</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my trail log! Here, I'll be documenting my journey on the Appalachian Trail, sharing stories, photos, and tips along the way.</p>
      <section>
        <h2>Day 1 - Start of the Journey</h2>
        <p>Today was the first day of my hike on the Appalachian Trail. I started at Amicalola Falls State Park in Georgia and hiked about 8 miles to the Springer Mountain trailhead.</p>

        <p>It was a beautiful day and the scenery was breathtaking. The trail was well-maintained and easy to follow. I met some other hikers along the way and we ended up camping together at a nearby campsite.</p>

        <h2>Day 2 - Into the Wilderness</h2>
        <p>Today, we hiked deeper into the wilderness and the scenery became even more stunning. We passed by waterfalls, crossed streams, and saw some wildlife including a black bear in the distance.</p>

        <p>The hike was challenging at times, but it was well worth it for the views. We camped near a lake and had a campfire under the stars.</p>

        <h2>Day 3 - Rest Day</h2>
        <p>Today, we took a rest day to recover from the previous two days of hiking. We relaxed by the lake, went fishing, and explored the area around our campsite.</p>

        <p>It was nice to take a break and just enjoy the natural beauty of the trail. I'm looking forward to continuing the journey tomorrow!</p>
